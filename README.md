## What is LunoLabs?

**LunoLabs** is a maker company based in Switzerland with two missions:

**🔧 Makerspaces** — Physical spaces where people learn, build, and create with professional tools like 3D printers, laser cutters, CNC machines, and electronics labs. We focus on youth education (12+) and run a Makerspace-as-a-Service model for communities.

**🧠 Context Box** — A local-first AI platform for companies. Your data stays on your hardware, powered by AI that understands your business. Currently in development.

> *"Zugang ist der Schlüssel"* — Access is the key.
